This is a minimalist version of SMC, a combustion code that solves
compressible Navier-Stokes equations for viscous multi-component
reacting flows.  SMC is developed at the Center for Computational
Sciences and Engineering (CCSE) at Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory.  It uses the BoxLib library
(https://ccse.lbl.gov/BoxLib/), also developed at CCSE.  This
minimalist version of SMC includes a stripped down version of BoxLib.
Therefore, the full version of BoxLib is not needed.

The code is mainly written in Fortran 90, with some parts in C.
Parallelization is implemented with hybrid MPI/OpenMP.  However, SMC
can also be built with pure MPI, or pure OpenMP, or neither.

GNU make is used to build the code.  The following options can be
specified in the GNUmakefile:

* MPI := t 
  This determines whether we are using the Message Passing
  Interface (MPI) library.  Leaving this option empty will disable
  MPI.  If MPI is enabled, you need to specify how to link to the MPI
  library.  You can set USE_MPI_WRAPPERS := t, then mpif90 will be
  used.  Or you can set "mpi_include_dir", "mpi_lib_dir", and
  "mpi_libraries" to appropriate values in GNUmakefile.

* OMP := 
  This determines whether we are using OpenMP.  Leaving this option
  empty disables OpenMP.

* NDEBUG := 
  This option determines whether we compile with support for debugging
  (usually also enabling some runtime checks). Setting NDEBUG := t
  turns off debugging.

* COMP := GNU
  Set this to your compiler of choice (e.g., GNU).  Specific options
  for a certain compiler are stored in the comps/$(COMP).mak file.   

* MIC :=
  Set this if compiling for Intel Xeon Phi.

* MKVERBOSE := t
  This determines the verbosity of the building process.

To build an executable, type "make" in the SMC directory.  The
executable will have a name like main.GNU.debug.mpi.exe depending
on the compiler and some other options specified in the GNUmakefile.
There are some other options provided by the GNUmakefile.  You can
type "make TAGS" or "make tags" to generate tag file for Email or vi.
You can type "make clean" or "make realclean" to remove files
generated during the make process.

Runtime parameters can be specified in the inputs_SMC file, which must
be placed in the directory where the executable is run.  Below are a
list of selected runtime parameters and default values.

* n_cellx = -1
* n_celly = -1
* n_cellz = -1

  Number of cells in the x, y, and z-directions.  They must be greater than 4.

* max_grid_size = 64 

  This determines the largest grid size of a box.  If max_grid_size is
  too big, there might be fewer boxes than MPI tasks, and then some
  processors will be idle.  However, if it is too small, each MPI task
  may have too many small boxes, and the performance will be affected.
  Thus, max_grid_size must be chosen according to the number of cells
  and the number of MPI tasks.  Ideally, you would like to have one
  box for each MPI task to minimize the communication cost.

* verbose = 0

  This determines verbosity.

* stop_time = -1.d0

  Simulation stop time.

* max_step = 1

  Maximum number of timesteps in the simulation.

Note that there are a number of OMP COLLAPSE clauses in the code.
These tend to trigger compiler bugs.  If the code crashes, try to run
it without "COLLAPSE".
